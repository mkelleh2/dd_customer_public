Fast retry results are used in this evaluation.\n **Total** | Evaluation of the test status.\n\nTo reduce alert fatigue, Synthetic tests can be retried when a test run fails. If you have configured a test to be retried on failures, this is a **fast retry**.\n\nWhile fast retry results are used in the local group evaluation, only the final retry is taken into account in the total group evaluation. The original run and all intermediate retries are discarded from the evaluation. A run that is still failing after it has reached the maximum number of retries is considered final, and this final result is taken into account in the total group evaluation.\n\nSee [\"Retries that overlap with other test runs\"](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/guide/synthetic-test-retries-monitor-status/#retries-that-overlap-with-other-test-runs) for visualizations that illustrate local vs. group evaluation for retries."}}}],"template_variables":[],"schema_version":0}}}
